          This year we launched the <em>Decoding the Future of Aesthetic Individuality</em> report, 
          which explores the concept of individuality– an emerging theme that we’ve identified 
          across beauty, aesthetics, and many other industries. The report underpins Allergan 
          Aesthetics commitment to understanding the aesthetic needs of consumers and its continued 
          support for practitioners in achieving the individual aesthetic goals of their patients.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Key themes from the report include: 
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Understanding Individuality:</strong> a deeply personal concept that constantly evolves on a journey of self-discovery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Rewards (and Limits) of Individuality:</strong> from the impact of social media to our evolutionary impulse to conform, 
            there are multiple elements that guide and influence each personal journey to embracing individuality. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Aesthetic Opportunity:</strong> by acknowledging that no ‘one-size fits all’, the aesthetics industry can drive 
            innovation and professional education that endorses a personalised approach to treatment and consultation, and ultimately
            empowers patients to define their own aesthetic individuality. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          The report is grounded by extensive research across consumer and business media, global social listening data, 
          and market and industry reports from multiple geographies, specifically Brazil, China, Japan, UK and USA. 
          Findings were validated through 1:1 interviews with some of the world’s leading aesthetics practitioners as 
          well as experts in psychology, beauty, marketing, consumer behavior and futures.
